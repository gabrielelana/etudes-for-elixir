# Études for Elixir

[Études for Elixir](http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1234000001642) is an open source book authored by **J. David Eisenberg** for O'Reilly Labs.

This is my personal working fork of Études for Elixir [github repository](https://github.com/oreillymedia/etudes-for-elixir) with the ultimate goal of practice the fundamentals of Elixir

An étude, according to Wikipedia, is "an instrumental musical composition, usually short and of considerable difficulty, usually designed to provide practice material for perfecting a particular musical skill."

In the mentioned book, you will find descriptions of programs that you can write in Elixir. The programs will usually be short, and each one has been designed to provide practice material for a particular Elixir programming concept. These programs have not been designed to be of considerable difficulty, though they may ask you to stretch a bit beyond the immediate material and examples that you find in the book [Introducing Elixir](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920030584.do).

Kudos to **J. David Eisenberg** for the wonderful work, every programming language should have something like this.
