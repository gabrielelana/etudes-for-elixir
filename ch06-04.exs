# In this Ã©tude, create a module named Random, and write a function
# generate_pockets/2. This function has a character list consisting of T and F
# for its first argument. A T in the list indicates that the tooth is present,
# and a F indicates a missing tooth. This will be a single quoted character list,
# so you can treat it just as you would any other list. Remember to refer to
# individual characters as ?T and ?F.
#
# The second argument is a floating point number between 0 and 1.0 that indicates
# the probability that a tooth will be a good tooth.
#
# The result is a list of lists, one list per tooth. If a tooth is present, the
# sublist has six entries; if a tooth is absent, the sublist is [0].
