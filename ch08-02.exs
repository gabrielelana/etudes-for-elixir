# Write a list comprehension that creates a list consisting of the names of all
# the people who are male and over 40. Use pattern matching to separate the
# tuple into three variables, and use two guards to do the tests for age and
# gender. When you use multiple guards in a list comprehension, you get the
# moral equivalent of combining the conditions with and.

# Then, write a list comprehension that selects the names of all the people who
# are male or over 40. You canâ€™t use multiple guards here; you want a single
# guard that explicitly uses the or operator.
